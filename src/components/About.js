                In 2019, I embarked on a journey into the world of software development, and since then, I've cultivated a deep 
                passion for crafting innovative web and mobile solutions. Eager to continuously expand my skill set, I find joy 
                in the process of learning and pushing the boundaries of what I can create.

                My professional focus revolves around building impactful products and spearheading projects for clients. I've 
                had the privilege of contributing to diverse sectors, having developed software for a 
                <a href="https://www.willfreight.com/"> shipping agency</a>, lent my expertise to an 
                <a href="https://www.ilabafrica.ac.ke/"> innovation lab</a>, and played a pivotal role in shaping the 
                tech landscape for a dynamic startup.

                Away from the keyboard, you'll often find me at the gym, channeling my energy into fitness, or on the football 
                field, indulging in the beautiful game. Life isn't all about code; it's about balance.
